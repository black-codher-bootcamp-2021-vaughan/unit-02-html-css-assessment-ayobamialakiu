                        <p>This project involved the end to end deployment and installation of both single phase and three phase prepaid energy meters. A total of 95,725 energy meters were installed at the end users premises within 6 months of project commencement  within budget parameters out of the 487,000 meant to be installed within the space of 4years. Customers were metered in less than 10working days as against the 10 days agreed upon in the service level agreement (SLA).
